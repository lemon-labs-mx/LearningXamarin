# Learning Xamarin.Forms
In this project you will learn the basics and (hopefully) beyond this magic world that **Xamarin.Forms** is.

## How is this repo organized?
We are going to be working with git branches, each branch has a main theme in mind.
You will have to follow the branches in order, because one will be carrying other code from past lessons.
The order is as follows:

> L1-SignificantName

Where `L1` is Lesson 1, separated by a `-` and `SignificantName` will try to describe shortly the lesson.
For example: `L8-Triggers`.

## Themes
These are the proposed themes, you can edit this file in your own repo to check the ones you already watched.
